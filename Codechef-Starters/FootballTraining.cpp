Football Training
As a football trainer, you have several players training under you. Each of these players are fans of either Leo or Ronald, but not both.
X of the players are fans of Leo, and want a free kick session to be carried out.
Y of the players are fans of Ronald, and want a penalty session to be carried out.
Note that each player is a fan of exactly one of Leo or Ronald, so there are X+Y players in total.

It'd be nice if players are actually interested in their training, so you decide to hold whichever type of training has more people interested in it.

Given X and Y, which type of training session will you hold?
It is guaranteed that X!=Y.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers X and Yâ€” which denote the number of Leo's fans and the number of Ronald's fans, respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line which session will be carried out: "FREEKICK" if it'll be a free kick session, and "PENALTY" if it'll be a penalty session (without quotes).

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, if the answer is PENALTY, the strings penalty, PENALTY, pEnALty, and so on will all be accepted.
